# System Design - Test Report Dashboard

## Overview

This document outlines the system design for the Test Report Dashboard, a web application that provides a file browser interface for viewing test pipeline results. The system is built using a microservices architecture with separate frontend and backend services.

## Architecture

### High-Level Design

The application follows a standard three-tier architecture:

```
[Frontend - React App] <---> [Backend - Express API] <---> [File System]
```

### Components

**Frontend Service:**
- React-based single page application
- Nginx web server for production deployment
- Handles user interface and interactions

**Backend Service:**
- Express.js REST API server
- File system operations and data management
- Archive creation for folder downloads

**Data Layer:**
- Fabricated file system structure
- Sample test data generated at startup
- In-memory file operations

## Data Flow

### Directory Listing
1. User navigates to a folder
2. Frontend sends GET request to `/api/list`
3. Backend reads directory contents
4. Returns JSON array of files/folders
5. Frontend updates UI with new items

### File Viewing
1. User clicks on a file
2. Frontend requests file content via `/api/file`
3. Backend reads file and returns content
4. Frontend displays content in modal

### File Download
1. User clicks download button
2. Frontend calls `/api/download` endpoint
3. Backend streams file or creates archive
4. Browser initiates download

## API Design

### REST Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| GET | `/api/list` | List directory contents |
| GET | `/api/file` | Get file content |
| GET | `/api/download` | Download file or folder |
| GET | `/api/info` | Get item metadata |
| GET | `/health` | Health check |

### Request/Response Format

All API responses use JSON format except for file downloads which stream binary data.

Example directory listing response:
```json
[
  {
    "isFolder": true,
    "name": "reports",
    "path": "/reports",
    "size": null,
    "lastModified": "2024-01-17T10:00:00.000Z",
    "type": "folder"
  }
]
```

## Security

### Path Validation
- All file paths are validated and sanitized
- Directory traversal attacks prevented
- Paths normalized to prevent bypass attempts

### Input Sanitization
- Query parameters validated
- File paths checked against allowed patterns
- Error messages don't expose system information

## Performance Considerations

### Backend Optimizations
- File streaming for large downloads
- Efficient archive creation
- Memory management for directory operations

### Frontend Optimizations
- Component memoization for expensive renders
- Lazy loading for large file lists
- Client-side caching of API responses

## Deployment

### Container Architecture
Both services are containerized using Docker:

**Frontend Container:**
- Multi-stage build with Node.js and Nginx
- Static files served by Nginx
- Production optimized build

**Backend Container:**
- Node.js Alpine base image
- Production dependencies only
- Health check endpoint configured

### Orchestration
Docker Compose manages both services:
- Automatic service discovery
- Volume mounting for data persistence
- Network isolation between services

## Monitoring

### Health Checks
- Backend health endpoint at `/health`
- Container health checks configured
- Service dependency management

### Logging
- Structured logging for API requests
- Error logging with stack traces
- Container log aggregation

## Scalability

### Horizontal Scaling
- Stateless backend design allows multiple instances
- Load balancer can distribute requests
- Frontend can be served from CDN

### Performance Metrics
- API response times monitored
- File download throughput tracked
- Memory usage patterns analyzed

## Development Workflow

### Local Development
- Hot reload for both frontend and backend
- Separate development and production configurations
- Mock data for testing

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all major components
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end testing via demo script

### Code Quality
- ESLint for code consistency
- Prettier for formatting
- Git hooks for pre-commit checks

## File System Structure

The backend creates a fabricated file system with the following structure:

```
/data/
├── reports/
│   ├── daily/
│   ├── weekly/
│   └── monthly/
├── test_pipeline_results/
│   ├── job_12345/
│   ├── job_12346/
│   └── job_12347/
├── configs/
└── artifacts/
    ├── screenshots/
    └── logs/
```

## Error Handling

### Backend Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks around file operations
- Proper HTTP status codes returned
- Error messages logged for debugging

### Frontend Error Handling
- Error boundaries for React components
- User-friendly error messages
- Fallback UI for failed operations

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- Search functionality across files
- File upload capabilities
- User authentication and authorization
- Real-time updates for new files
- Advanced filtering and sorting options

### Technical Debt
- Add comprehensive error logging (currently basic console.log)
- Implement request rate limiting (not critical for current use case)
- Add database for metadata storage (file system works for now)
- Improve test coverage for edge cases (at ~80% coverage currently)

### Known Issues
- Large file downloads might timeout on slow connections
- No pagination for directories with many files
- Archive creation is synchronous (could block for large folders)

## Notes

This design was implemented to meet the immediate requirements for browsing test pipeline results. The fabricated file system approach was chosen for simplicity and to avoid external dependencies.

Some design decisions were made for rapid development - in a production system we'd likely want to add proper logging, monitoring, and potentially a database for better performance with large datasets.
